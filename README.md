# Pebble - Turning Daily Browsing into Discovery For Kids  üåê‚ú®

## üåü Inspiration
Kids spend a huge amount of time online ‚Äî browsing videos, articles, and websites every day.
But most of this content is written for adults, filled with complex ideas, or sometimes even unsafe.

This creates two problems:
1. Children miss out on valuable knowledge
2. They risk encountering inappropriate content

Since kids are already spending so much time browsing, we should leverage today‚Äôs advanced technology such as AI to turn those moments into opportunities for safe learning. 

**Pebble**, the **Chrome Extension** was created to solve this problem. It turns everyday browsing into a **safe, kid-friendly learning experience**. 

By simplifying complex text, translating content, and adding interactive quizzes and fun facts, Pebble ensures that no browsing moment is wasted ‚Äî every click becomes an opportunity to learn.

## üìñ Key Features
